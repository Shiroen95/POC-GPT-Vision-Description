To ensure a clean and hygienic bathroom space, commence by clearing out any personal items from the sink's surface 
and surrounding shelves. This allows for thorough cleaning access. Once the area is decluttered, 
proceed with the following sub-tasks:

1. Sink Cleaning: Apply a bathroom cleaner to the basin of the sink, targeting any visible residue or grime. 
With a non-abrasive sponge, scrub the sink in circular motions, focusing on the drain and any stains. 
Rinse thoroughly with water and wipe dry with a clean microfiber cloth to prevent water spots.

2. Faucet and Fixtures: Using the same bathroom cleaner, spray faucets and handles. 
Let it sit for a brief moment before scrubbing with a soft brush or sponge to address any buildup. 
Rinse or wipe clean and dry with a cloth to restore shine.

3. Counter and Shelf Wiping: Using a suitable surface cleaner, spray the counter, 
including the top and inner area of any cabinets or drawers. Wipe down with a sponge or cloth,
 ensuring to reach into corners and edges where dust and debris can accumulate. 
 Carefully approach items affixed to the wall, such as soap dispensers or toothbrush holders, to avoid dislodging them.

4. Mirror Cleaning: Spray a streak-free glass cleaner onto the mirror, 
ensuring to cover the entire surface evenly. Using a clean, lint-free cloth or paper towel, 
wipe the mirror using a 'Z' pattern motion to eliminate smudges and streaks.

5. Trash Removal: Ensure the trash bin is emptied and replace the liner if necessary. 
Wipe the exterior of the bin if there are any spots or splashes.

After completing each sub-task, return any items previously removed to their rightful place, 
organizing them neatly to maintain a tidy appearance. Always rinse cleaning tools and allow them to dry before storage.
 Final inspection of the area is recommended to ensure no spots were missed and the bathroom is left in an immaculate condition."
