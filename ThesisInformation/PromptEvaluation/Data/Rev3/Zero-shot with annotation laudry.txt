    cycle based on the pile you are starting with (e.g., whites, delicates). Once the clothes are washed,
     transfer them to the dryer, if available, or hang them up to air dry. Ensure that the area around 
     the washing machine is clean and free of any spilled detergent or debris. If the floors are dirty,
      sweep and mop the area to maintain a clean space. Lastly, fold or hang the clean clothes once they 
      are dry."}

"body": "The primary goal is to clean the laundry using the washing machine. 

1. Sort the laundry in the basket by color and fabric type. Separate whites, lights, and darks, and divide delicate items from regular ones to prevent damage during washing.

2. Check the pockets of all garments for items that may cause damage to the clothes or washing machine, such as coins, keys, or tissues.

3. Load the sorted clothes into the washing machine, being careful not to overload it as this can affect the quality of the wash and the functioning of the machine.

4. Pick an appropriate detergent. Use the one for whites with the white load and a color-safe detergent for colored clothes.

5. Set the washing machine to the appropriate settings according to the fabric type. Heavier items like towels and bed linens often require a stronger wash cycle than delicate items.

6. Once the settings are in place, start the washing machine. While the machine is running, clean the area around the washing machine, organizing detergents, and disposing of any trash or empty containers.

7. After the washing cycle is completed, promptly remove the clothes from the washing machine to prevent wrinkles or odors. Hang the clothes to dry or use a dryer if available, using the correct heat setting for the fabric type.

8. Fold or hang the clean laundry once it is dry and return it to the appropriate closets and drawers."
