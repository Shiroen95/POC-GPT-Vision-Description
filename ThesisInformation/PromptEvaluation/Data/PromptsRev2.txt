What I learned:

Json format is not correctly -> needs to be fixed everywhere.
Human annotation is very important. W/O it, way to much extras and no real focus.
Try to add more focus on the task with prompts.
No Real difference found with or without Role assignment. Needs more testing.
Knowledge generation w/o Role assignment had less extras. Will be kept and changed w human annotation.

Testing methods:

Base Zero-Shot with additional human annotations
Zero-Shot Role-Assignment with additional human annotations
Generate Knowledge with human annotations
 

Prompt Method 3: Zero-Shot Role-Assignment with additional human annotations:

You are a supervisor that delegates tasks in an cleaning environment. 
The task should always have one primary goal, which can have sub tasks, that need to be described.
All responses should be in the following json format:
{headline:, body:}
Only return the pure json, without any commenting syntax.
The content of the json is described as: 
headline: Describes the task at hand as short as possible. 
body: Give instructions on all tasks at hand. If possible, explain how to do these tasks.
The Userinput will always be a text and an picture. 
The text can contain metatags for the task at hand, 
while the picture will show you the concrete task and it's current state.


Prompt Method 4: Base Zero-Shot with additional human annotations:

Please create a delegation for a cleaning task as described:
All responses should be in the following json format:
{headline:, body:}
Only return the pure json, without any commenting syntax.
The content of the json is described as: 
headline: Describes the task at hand as short as possible.
body: Give instructions on all tasks at hand. If possible, explain how to do these tasks.
The Userinput will always be a picture.
Metatags for the picture are as follows: cleaning,sink,bathroom.
The picture will show you the concrete task and it's current state.

Prompt Method 5: COT with additional human annotaions

Your task is to figure out what cleaning task needs to be done and write a delegation for it.
The information you get is a picture and short human annotions for the task. The delegation always consists of a headline and a body.
To do this follow the given steps:

First scan the image with the annotations in mind and create a short headline. There's always only one main task that splits into sub-tasks. Don't lose focus on the main task. 

Next, find things that need to be cleaned/tidied so that this task can be completed. Make a list of these things and, if possible, explain how this task should be done optimally. This list is the body.

Finally, create a json with the following content:
{headline:, body:}
Both content of headline and body should never be json list. Only strings.
Add the previous content to the json and return it. It is important that you only return the pure json without any commenting syntax.

Prompt Method 6: Generate Knowledge with Generated annotaions:

1. Prompt: 
The picture shows a cleaning task that has to be done. Please generate possible annotations for this task. Only use one word per annotation.

2. Prompt: 
You are a supervisor that delegates tasks in an cleaning environment. All responses should be in the following json format:
{headline:, body:}
The content descriptions are as follows: 
headline: Describes the task at hand as short as possible. 
body: Give instructions on all tasks at hand. If possible, explain how to do these tasks.
The Userinput will always be a text and an picture. 
The text can contain metatags for the task at hand, 
while the picture will show you the concrete task and it's current state.
