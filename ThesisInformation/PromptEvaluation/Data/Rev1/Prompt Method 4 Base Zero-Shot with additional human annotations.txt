  "body": "Begin by clearing the sink and countertop area of any personal items, such as toothbrushes, shaving supplies, 
  and skincare products. Use an all-purpose cleaner or a bathroom cleaner to spray down the sink, countertop, faucet, and handles. 
  Allow the cleaner to sit for a few minutes to break down soap scum and toothpaste residue. 

  With a non-abrasive sponge, scrub the basin of the sink, focusing on any stains or deposits around the drain. 
  Move on to wipe the countertop and the faucet, ensuring to clean around the edges and the base where dirt can accumulate.
   Rinse the sponge or use a clean cloth with water to rinse away any remaining cleaning product from all surfaces.

  Dry the surfaces with a clean, dry cloth to prevent water spots. 
  Polish the faucet and handles with a microfiber cloth for a streak-free finish. 

  Lastly, replace the personal items neatly, discarding any that are empty or no longer needed. 
  The countertop should have minimal items left on it, only the essentials, to maintain a clean and organized appearance.

  If present, use glass cleaner for the mirror above the sink, spraying it directly onto a cloth or the mirror surface and wiping 
  it down until all marks and splatters are removed, and the surface shines.

  Ensure the area is left tidy, well-organized, and dry to conclude the task."
